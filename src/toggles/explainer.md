## Introduction

There are many use-cases
where an interaction (click/gesture) on one element
toggles a 'state' that can be shared with other elements.
This can range from toggling light/dark mode,
to activating slide-in navigation,
opening and closing menus,
or interacting with sectioned content
as tabs, accordions, or carousels.
HTML also provides the `<input type=checkbox>` element,
with a "checked" state that toggles between `true` and `false`
when the user activates the element,
and which can be selected by the `:checked` pseudoclass.

These cases currently require custom Javascript,
which adds a barrier for authors otherwise capable
of implementing the visual design --
and often results in less performant,
less accessible solutions.

We propose generalizing the pattern
so that it can be applied to any element
using a declarative syntax in CSS,
with built-in accessibility and performance.

## Goals [or Motivating Use Cases, or Scenarios]

To borrow language from Nicole Sullivan:

> a _gesture_
> on a _trigger_
> causes a _state change_
> on a _target_

Where:

- a _gesture_ is some form of user interaction,
  like click/enter activation, scrolling, etc
- a _trigger_ and a _target_ are both elements in the DOM
  (often different elements, but sometimes the same element)
- a _state change_ can be moving through a list of possible states,
  or setting a particular state

Several of the expected use-cases
involve showing and hiding content
based on the state of a toggle:

- tabs
- accordions / tree views
- carousels
- popups
- dialogs
- summary/details
- off-canvas menus

However, there are also use-cases
for a toggle to have less invasive impact:

- light/dark/high-contrast/auto color themes
- adjusting font sizes
- adjusting compact/comfortable spacing
- adjusting 'views', eg calendar/agenda or horizontal/vertical layout

The [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/) project
has been working on new elements/attributes
that could help with some of these use-cases
at a high level --
such as panel sets ('spicy sections'),
selectmenus, and popups.
It's our goal that CSS toggles provide
some shared functionality
that those elements & attributes can rely on,
while also giving authors access
to define new toggle-based patterns.

Along the way,
we have a few goals for
_how this feature should work_:

- Accessibility should be baked in by default,
  rather than relying on author intervention
- Relationships between a trigger and its impact
  should be established and accessed in CSS,
  rather than relying on unique IDs or selectors-as-property-values.
- JS should not be required in the most common use-cases

## Non-goals

### Managing application state

While there is a much larger need
for improved application state management on the web,
this proposal is focused specifically on the needs of CSS.
That line is not necessarily clean and simple to define --
but we think that:

- State changes which need to update the DOM,
  or be 'saved' into app state
  should be primarily handled outside CSS.
  Those are not presentation-specific concerns.
- It should still be possible to use this feature
  in tandem with other web languages
  to represent/display those more complex application states in CSS.

For example, interacting with a 'tab' or 'accordion' design pattern
is a purely presentational concern that requires some state management.
However, changing the 'status' of a user/page
from 'logged out' to 'logged-in' --
or deleting an item from a list --
are broader application states
that may only be 'reflected' in the presentation.

That means we need both:

- a CSS syntax that allows for handling presentational needs
- an API allowing other web languages to read & set CSS states when necessary

### Potential name confusion

The term 'toggle' has been used in reference to
various different features over the years.

[CSS Values & Units level 5](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-5/#funcdef-toggle)
defines an (unimplemented) `toggle()` function that allows
cycling through a set of values as elements are nested.
For example, toggling between `italic`/`normal`
or cycling through different list markers:

```css
em { font-style: toggle(italic; normal); }
ul { list-style-type: toggle(disc; circle; square; box); }
```

This proposal is unrelated to that CSS function.
(We might want to bikeshed the naming of one or the other).
[David Baron has proposed][cycle] `cycle()`
as an alternative name for the `toggle()` function.

[cycle]: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/1999May/0067

The word is also sometimes used
in reference to '[switch](https://open-ui.org/components/switch)' components.
While this proposal has some overlap with a switch --
it could be used to generate the switch behavior --
we are not attempting to define a new element here.

It's also possible that the term 'toggle' could cause confusion,
as many might expect it to have a boolean (on/off) behavior.
The current proposal, however, allows for any number of desired states.

## Proposal for declarative CSS toggles

### Broad overview

This proposal relies on several primary concepts.
First off the toggles themselves:

- Every **toggle** has a name, a current state,
  set number of possible states,
  and some metadata for determining
  how to move between states by default.
- Any element can become a **toggle root**
  for any number of toggles,
  using the `toggle-root` property.

Once we have toggles,
we need a way to access them --
both for the sake of _changing_ state,
and also in order to _use_ that state somehow.
Every toggle has a **toggle scope**
of elements that are able to 'see' or alter its state.
That scope includes the toggle-root element
and any descendants (similar to inheritance),
as well as (optionally) siblings and the descendants of siblings
(similar to the css counters).

Any element that can 'see' and access a given toggle:

- Can become a **trigger** for that toggle
  using the `toggle-trigger` property,
  such that interactions on the trigger element
  update the state of the toggle.
- Can use the `:toggle()` pseudo-class
  to select based on the current state of the toggle

It's important for authors to understand
the distinctions between these things:

- The _toggle root element_, where a toggle is 'hosted'
- The _toggle scope_, where a toggle is 'visible'
- Any number of _toggle trigger elements_,
  which can update the toggle state when activated

### Establishing toggles (`toggle-root`)

The `toggle-root` property
generates new toggles on a given element,
and controls how those toggles behave.
The overall syntax allows either `none`,
or a comma-separated list of toggle definitions.

A simple auto/light/dark color-mode toggle
might be defined on the document root:

```css
:root {
  /* color-mode toggle with 2 active states */
  toggle-root: color-mode 2;
}
```

{% warn %}
We could consider adding longhand properties
for the various parts of the toggle description,
and make `toggle-root` into a shorthand.
But that's not a simple request for implementors,
since it would involve
collating multiple list-valued properties.
{% endwarn %}

#### Toggle names

Each toggle definition begins with
a (required) **toggle name** --
an identifier that allows us to access this particular toggle.

#### Toggle states

After the name, we can optionally define
the initial and maximum states.
States are (currently) represented as integers,
where `0` is considered 'inactive'
and there can be any number of 'active' states
represented by positive integers:

- The **maximum state** (`[1,âˆž]`) defaults to `1` (a binary toggle),
  and represents the number of possible active states.
- The **initial state** (`[0,<maximum>]`) defaults to `0` (inactive),
  and can be any number less than or equal to the maximum.

If a single integer is given,
that sets the maximum state.
To set both the initial and maximum,
we can use two `/`-divided integers in the form
`<initial-state>/<maximum-state>`.

```css
:root {
  /* 2 active states (initially inactive) */
  toggle-root: color-mode 2;
  /* same result as above */
  toggle-root: color-mode 0/2;
}

.my-toggle {
  /* 4 active states (initially in 2nd active state) */
  toggle-root: my-toggle 2/4;
}
```

{% warn 'ToDo' %}
We plan to also allow for a list of 'named states',
which would provide more clarity around the purpose of a state
beyond simple numbering.
{% endwarn %}

#### Toggle keywords

Finally, there are three optional boolean keywords:

- **sticky**: boolean (`false` if omitted)
  indicates the behavior for moving past the maximum state --
  either remaining active (returning to `1`) if sticky,
  or deactivating (returning to `0`) if omitted
- **group**: boolean (`false` if omitted)
  indicates if this toggle is part of a
  '[_toggle group_](#grouping-exclusive-toggles-toggle-group)'
  using the same name
- **self**:  boolean (`false` if omitted)
  optionally narrows '_toggle scope_' (what elements 'see' the toggle)
  to descendant elements (narrow scope) --
  otherwise a toggle is also visible to
  following siblings & their descendants (wide scope),
  similar to a CSS counter

{% warn 'Question' %}
There should be an option similar to `sticky`
that makes the default progression linear,
without cycling back to either `0` or `1`.
{% endwarn %}

### Establishing toggle triggers (`toggle-trigger`)

Once a toggle has been established,
any elements inside the _scope_ of that toggle
can be set as 'triggers' for that scope,
using the `toggle-trigger` property.
Triggers would become activatable in the page
(part of the focus order, and able to receive interaction) --
so that user-activation of the trigger element
increments the state of one or more toggles.

{% warn 'ToDo' %}
Need to define what it means
to 'become activatable' --
including how that interacts with future gestures,
beyond simple click/keyboard activation.
{% endwarn %}

The `toggle-trigger` property can be set to `none`,
or a comma-separated list of one or more
toggle-activation instructions.
Each instruction includes:

- The _name_ of the toggle to activate
- An (optional) _target state_ for the toggle

When a trigger is activated by a user,
then for each toggle listed,
if a toggle of that name is visible to the trigger,
its state is either incremented by 1 (default)
or moved to the _target state_ (if valid).

To trigger the color-mode toggle created above,
we could add triggers anywhere in the page
(since the toggle scope is the entire document in this case).
Triggers could either cycle the value,
or set it to a particular state:

```css
button[toggle-colors] {
  /* advance toggle to next state on activation */
  toggle-trigger: color-mode;
}

button[toggle-colors='auto'] {
  /* set toggle to a specific state on activation */
  toggle-trigger: color-mode 0;
}
```

{% warn 'Question' %}
Are there other types of incrementing we might need?
For example: an option to 'reverse increment',
e.g. for moving backwards in a carousel?
{% endwarn %}

### Combined root and trigger shorthand (`toggle`)

While it can be useful to have them separate,
there are many use-cases where the same element
can act as both _root_ and _trigger_ for a toggle.
The `toggle` shorthand property
has the same syntax as `toggle-root`,
but establishes the element as both root and trigger.

For example,
a definition list:

```html
<dl class='accordion'>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Long description......</dd>
  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>Another long description.....</dd>
</dl>
```

Could set each term as both a toggle  root
and a trigger for its own toggle:

```css
.accordion > dt {
  toggle: glossary;
}
```

{% note %}
When multiple toggles have the same name
and overlapping scope,
an element will only see the 'closer' toggle --
so each `glossary` toggle in the example
is only available to the `dd` element that comes immediately after
(before another `glossary` toggle is defined)
{% endnote %}

### Toggling visibility (`toggle-visibility`)

One of the common use-cases for this feature
is the ability to build various types of
'disclosure widget' --
from tabs and accordions, to popups, and details/summary.
It's essential that we make that
both simple to achieve and also accessible by default.
In many cases,
we want this 'off-screen' (temporarily hidden) content
to remain available for accessibility features,
in-page searching, linking, focus, etc.
The `toggle-visibility` property
allows an element to automatically tie its display
to the state of a particular toggle.

{% note %}
The existing
[`content-visibility` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility)
provides an `auto` value,
allowing the contents to remain accessible
to various searching and accessibility features
like find-in-page, hash-navigation, or tab order,
when hidden from rendering --
but then to automatically become visible
when the element becomes relevant to the user.
The `toggle-visibility` property
would work similarly.
{% endnote %}

In addition to changing visibility based on the toggle state,
this allows us to change the toggle based on its visibility.
If a currently-hidden element becomes 'relevant to the user'
(through linking, search, etc)
then the toggle is set to an active state,
and the content is displayed.

The spec currently allows `normal` (no effect)
or `toggle <toggle-name>` values.
Using our definition-list example above,
we can add visibility-toggling to the definitions --
hidden by default,
but connected to toggle state
and available when relevant:

```css
.accordion > dt {
  toggle: glossary;
}

.accordion > dd {
  toggle-visibility: toggle glossary;
}
```

{% warn 'Question' %}
Should we extend this syntax to allow
associating an element `toggle-visibility`
with a _particular_ active state?
Something like
`toggle-visibility: toggle tabs 3;`
could associate the visibility of an element
with the 3rd active state of the `tabs` toggle.
See the [toc-style tab markup](#tabs-using-table-of-contents-code-order)
use-case, for example.
{% endwarn %}

### Selecting based on toggle state (`:toggle()`)

While toggling visibility is common,
there are often associated styles based on the same state
(e.g. styling the active tab, when its contents are visible) --
or toggles that don't relate to visibility at all.
The `:toggle()` functional pseudo-class
allows us to select elements based on the state of a toggle
(as long as the element is in that toggle's scope)
and style based on the toggle state.

The function itself requires a toggle-name,
and also accepts an optional integer
for selecting on specific active states
when there are multiple.

With our auto/light/dark mode example,
we can apply the color theme on the root element:

```css
html { /* auto settings, using media queries */ }
html:toggle(color-mode 1) {
  /* light mode color settings */
}
html:toggle(color-mode 2) {
  /* dark mode color settings */
}
```

We can also add active styling to the triggers:

```css
button[toggle-colors='dark']:toggle(color-mode 2) {
  border-color: cyan;
}
```

### Grouping exclusive toggles (`toggle-group`)

Toggles can also be grouped together
using the `toggle-group` property --
in which case only one toggle from the group
can be 'active' at a time.

This is similar to how radio inputs work in HTML,
but would also be useful in describing patterns like
tabs or exclusive accordions.

See the
'[tab and accordion toggle-groups](#tab-and-exclusive-accordion-toggle-groups)'
section
for a full example of this use-case.

{% note %}
Toggle groups are not the same
as '[focus groups](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/401)'
proposed elsewhere.
The former impacts how _multiple toggles_ relate
(one active at a time),
while the latter allows _multiple triggers_
to be grouped in the tab order
(one tab-stop for all interactions).
Existing HTML radio input behavior
would require both features --
grouping both the trigger focus and states.
{% endnote %}

{% warn 'Question' %}
Would it be possible to address focus-grouping from CSS,
as part of this proposal,
or does that focus-management require an HTML attribute?
{% endwarn %}

### Javascript API for CSS toggles

{% note 'ToDo' %}Needs explainer{% endnote %}

## Key scenarios

{% note 'ToDo' %}
Copy earlier examples into this section,
and flesh out additional use-cases.
{% endnote %}

### Binary switch

We can recreate the basic behavior
of a self-toggling checkbox
or switch component:

```css
.switch {
  toggle: switch;
}

.switch:toggle(switch) {
  /* style the active state */
}
```

### Details and accordion disclosure components

The behavior of a details/summary element
can be replicated:

```css
summary {
  toggle: details;
}

details > :not(summary) {
  toggle-visibility: toggle details;
}
```

This can be extended to a whole
list of elements,
to create a non-exclusive accordion:

```html
<dl class='accordion'>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Long description......</dd>
  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>Another long description.....</dd>
</dl>
```

Where each term toggles the following definitions:

```css
.accordion > dt {
  toggle: glossary;
}

.accordion > dd {
  toggle-visibility: toggle glossary;
}
```

Both of these examples
rely on the toggled content following the trigger element.
By moving the toggle-root to a wrapping element
we can avoid that restriction.
With this code,
the summary is no longer required to come first:

```css
details {
  toggle-root: details;
}

summary {
  toggle-trigger: details;
}

details > :not(summary) {
  toggle-visibility: toggle details;
}
```

### Tree views

A tree view
can be created by nesting
the accordion/disclosure pattern:

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href='#'>home</a></li>
  <li>
    <button class='tree'>resources</button>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='#'>articles</a></li>
      <li><a href='#'>demos</a></li>
      <li>
        <button class='tree'>media</button>
        <ul>
          <li><a href='#'>audio</a></li>
          <li><a href='#'>visual</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

And applying the show/hide behavior
at every level:

```css
.tree {
  toggle: tree;
}

.tree + ul {
  toggle-visibility: toggle tree;
}
```

### Tab and exclusive-accordion toggle-groups

Given the following HTML
(similar to the proposed 'spicy sections' element):

```html
<panel-set>
  <panel-tab>first tab</panel-tab>
  <panel-card>first panel content</panel-card>
  <panel-tab>second tab</panel-tab>
  <panel-card>second panel content</panel-card>
</panel-set>
```

We can define the exclusive/grouped behavior
using toggles:

```css
panel-set {
  /* The common ancestor establishes a group */
  toggle-group: tab;
}

panel-tab {
  /* Each tab creates a sticky toggle
    (so once itâ€™s open, clicking again wonâ€™t close it),
    opts into the group,
    and declares itself a toggle activator */
  toggle: tab 1 group sticky;
}

panel-tab:first-of-type {
  /* The first tab also sets its initial state
    to be active */
  toggle: tab 1/1 group sticky;
}

panel-tab:toggle(tab) {
  /* styling for the active tab */
}

panel-card {
  /* card visibility is linked to toggle state */
  toggle-visibility: toggle tab;
}
```

The same CSS works,
even if additional wrappers are added
around each tab/card pair:

```html
<panel-set>
  <panel-wrap>
    <panel-tab>first tab</panel-tab>
    <panel-card>first panel content</panel-card>
  </panel-wrap>
  <panel-wrap>
    <panel-tab>second tab</panel-tab>
    <panel-card>second panel content</panel-card>
  </panel-wrap>
</panel-set>
```

### Tabs using table-of-contents code order?

In order to properly layout tabs
as a group above the panel contents,
it's common for tab components
use a table-of-contents approach to the markup:

```html
<panel-set>
  <tab-list>
    <panel-tab>first tab</panel-tab>
    <panel-tab>second tab</panel-tab>
  </tab-list>
  <card-list>
    <panel-card>first panel content</panel-card>
    <panel-card>second panel content</panel-card>
  </card-list>
</panel-set>
```

This complicates things,
since we can no longer rely on
the flow of toggle-scopes
to associate each trigger
with an individual iteration of the toggle.

The rough behavior is still possible to achieve,
using a single sticky toggle
with multiple active states,
but it requires somewhat explicit
nth-of-type/nth-child selectors:

```css
/* shared toggle with an active state for each tab-panel */
panel-set {
  toggle-root: tabs 1/<tab-count> sticky;
}

/* each tab sets an explicit state */
panel-tab:nth-child(<tab-position>) {
  toggle-trigger: tabs <tab-position>;
}

/* each panel responds to an explicit state */
panel-card:nth-child(<tab-position>):toggle(tabs <tab-position>) {
  display: block;
}
```

There are several ways
we might be able to improve on this.
Most important, perhaps,
we could consider extending `toggle-visibility`
to accept not only a toggle name,
but also a specific active state.

{% warn 'Question' %}
Can we also improve on
the bulky/repetitive selector logic here?
That seems like it would require
a feature more like the `sibling-count()`/`sibling-index()`
[functions proposed elsewhere](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4559).
{% endwarn %}

### Carousels and slide-shows?

The current spec doesn't have great support
for carousel-like design patterns,
but it wouldn't take much to improve the basics.
Let's imagine the following html structure:

```html
<section>
  <article>â€¦</article>
  <article>â€¦</article>
  <article>â€¦</article>
  <article>â€¦</article>
</section>
```

We can add a toggle
to track the state of the carousel:

```css
section {
  /* 4 is the number of slides */
  /* sticky behavior starting at 1 ensures a slide is always active */
  toggle-root: slides 1/4 sticky
}
```

From here, we're in a similar situation to the
'table-of-contents' example above.
Ideally we would want some way to tie
`article` visibility to the specific state of our toggle.
Failing that, we can do something like:

```css
/* articles end up on the left */
article {
  transform: translateX(var(--x, -100%));
  transition: transform 300ms ease-out;
}

/* bring the active slide into view */
article:nth-child(<n>):toggle(slides <n>) {
  --x: 0;
}

/* move upcoming slides to the right */
article:nth-child(<n>):toggle(slides <n>) ~ article {
  --x: -100%;
}
```

For navigating the carousel,
both pagination controls and a 'next slide' trigger
would be straight-forward.
We just need to put them
anywhere visible to the `section` element:

```css
.next-slide {
  toggle-trigger: slides;
}

.to-slide-3 {
  toggle-trigger: slides 3;
}
```

At this point, we likely want a way
for triggers to reverse-increment,
so that we can also add a 'previous slide' trigger.

In many cases,
we would also want to control this carousel
using scroll,
in addition to (or instead of) buttons.
That would require further integration
with scroll/snapping behavior,
which hasn't been defined.

## Detailed Design Discussion

### Interaction between scrolling and toggles

For the carousel, and other design patterns,
it would be useful to have a two-way integration
between toggles and scrolling/scroll-snapping,
so that:

- Scrolling/snapping could trigger active state
- Changing active state could change scroll position

### Avoiding recursive behavior with toggle selectors

In order to allow selector access to toggles
(using the `:toggle()` functional pseudo-class)
without causing recursive behavior,
toggles exist and persist as independent state on a given element --
unaffected by any CSS properties.

CSS properties can only:
- create new toggles, and establish their initial state
- add or remove toggle-triggering behavior

### Accessibility implications

- a toggle-trigger element needs to become activatable/focusable/etc,
  and communicate in the a11y tree that itâ€™s a checkbox/radio/etc
- we can infer what type of control it is
  by examining the properties of the toggle:
  if itâ€™s part of a group, sticky, etc.
- if `toggle-visibility` is in use,
  we can also automatically infer all the tab-set ARIA roles

### Other component interactions

There are several important interactions
with related features
that we need to keep in mind
(some may require additional research):

- gestures
  (long-term, toggles should not be limited to tap/click/enter activation)
- tab/accordion '[panel set/section list][sl]' element (aka 'spicy sections')
- [popup][] attributes
  - can open/close use toggles?
  - can toggles work with 'light dismiss'?
